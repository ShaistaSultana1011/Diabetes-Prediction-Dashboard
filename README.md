# Diabetes-Prediction-Dashboard

This project provides an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing and predicting diabetes trends based on health data, gender, age, and other medical conditions such as heart disease and hypertension. It aims to uncover insights into how different factors influence the risk of diabetes and its comorbidities.

ðŸ’¡ Objective

The goal of this dashboard is to:

Help healthcare analysts identify at-risk populations

Enable proactive healthcare planning

Support data-driven decision making in public health initiatives

ðŸ”¢ Key Metrics:

Total Diabetes Cases: 8,500

Total Heart Disease Cases: 3,942

Average Age: 41.89 years

Total Blood Glucose Level: 14M

Total Hypertension Cases: 7,485

ðŸ“Š Insights

1. High Prevalence of Diabetes
   
A total of 8,500 individuals have diabetes, which indicates a significant portion of the dataset.

2. Gender Distribution

Females (52.48%) have a slightly higher proportion of diabetes cases compared to Males (47.52%).

This gender imbalance may indicate a higher vulnerability or lifestyle-related risk among Females.

3. Diabetes Increases With Age
   
Diabetes cases gradually increase with age and spike sharply around age 80, indicating that the elderly are at the highest risk.

Consistent growth is observed from age 40 onwards.

4. High Overlap with Heart Disease & Hypertension
   
3,942 people have heart disease, and 7,485 have hypertension.

Many diabetic patients also suffer from hypertension and heart disease, suggesting strong comorbid relationships.

5. Health Metrics Remain High Across Age Groups
   
Blood Glucose, HbA1c, and BMI values remain elevated across most age ranges, with a slight upward trend in older age.

High BMI and blood glucose levels are consistently seen in patients with heart disease.

6. Female Non-Smokers Still Have High Health Risk
   
Among female patients who never smoked:

2,002 have diabetes

2,043 have hypertension

567 have heart disease

Despite having no smoking history, this group still shows high incidence across all three conditions.

7. Heart Disease Prevalence in All Groups
   
Heart disease is present across all patient groups, including those with:

Only Diabetes

Only Hypertension

Both Diabetes & Hypertension

Heart disease is prevalent across all condition groups, with slightly higher risk when both conditions are present.

âœ… Recommendations

1. Prioritize Screening for Ages 40+

Launch early screening programs for individuals aged 40 and above, especially targeting blood glucose and blood pressure monitoring.

2. Target Female Population for Awareness Campaigns
   
Create Female-focused health interventions and lifestyle awareness campaigns, particularly around diet, exercise, and routine check-ups.

3. Monitor and Support Elderly Patients
   
Special attention should be given to patients over 60, with personalized care plans due to the sharp rise in diabetes and heart disease cases at older ages.

4. Integrate Care for Comorbid Conditions
   
Design integrated health plans that simultaneously address diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, since these frequently co-occur.


5. Improve Lifestyle Interventions for High BMI
   
Promote weight management programs and nutritional counseling, as high BMI appears strongly linked to both diabetes and heart disease across all ages.

6. Deploy Predictive Analytics in Public Health
   
Use models that integrate blood glucose, HbA1c, BMI, and age to predict high-risk patients and intervene before conditions escalate.

7. Do Not Ignore Non-Smokers in Preventive Care
   
A common assumption is that non-smokers are at lower risk, but data shows even never-smoked females experience high diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.

Health checkups should include non-smokers, especially females, in the 40+ age group, as a priority screening population.

8. Investigate Non-Smoking Risk Factors
   
Since large numbers of heart disease cases are seen in non-smokers, it's vital to:

Analyze lifestyle, diet, sedentary habits, family history, and stress levels

9. Educate Based on Misconceptions

Many people believe heart disease and diabetes primarily affect smokers. Use this data to raise awareness that:

Non-smokers are not exempt from chronic conditions.
